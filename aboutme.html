    <p class="c">Hi, I'm Max Schleuning. I am the oldest of three siblings and I have a dog named Cosmo. I am a junior at Piedmont High School. My favorite classes this year are math, physics, and computer science. 
    </p>

    <p class="c"> From a young age, I have been playing soccer. In previous years, I played for the Bay Oaks' DA team. However, since the pandemic, I lost interest in soccer and began playing golf. At PHS, I play soccer and am the captain of the PHS golf team.
