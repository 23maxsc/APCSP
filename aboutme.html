    <p class="c">Hi, I'm Max Schleuning. I am the oldest of three siblings and I have a dog named Cosmo. I am a junior at Piedmont High School. My favorite classes this year are math, physics, and computer science. I like these courses because they function together; I am able to apply what I learn in math to physics and I am able to apply what I learn in math and physics to computer science. I try to involve myself in a lot of projects that build off of these interests.
    </p>

    <p class="c"> From a young age, I have been playing soccer. In previous years, I played for the Bay Oaks' DA team. However, since the pandemic, I lost interest in soccer and began playing golf. At PHS, I play soccer and am the captain of the PHS golf team. In the future, I look forward to advancing my computer science skills. This summer, I am looking to take a course on CAD and next year I am looking to join the FRC team at PHS.
